# Pippin-Machine-Simulator

This was a final project for my class. It is a simple computer with very limited memory and CPU. 

It is intended to compile PASM files and convert it into an excutable to run it on the GUI to show step by step instructions of machine code being executed and sorted in memory. Not only that, it can catch assembly, run-time, or syntax errors. Users can manually select to go step by step or do a final result run as well as clear, pause, or reload as well. This program allows students to understand how programings in high level languages can be translated and run on a simple computer. 

Parts of the program and GUI were written by Professor Lander.

To run:

1.Place the files in the correct project files (project and project view)
2.Run Pippin_Run from the projectview file.
3.Use the example PASM files and load it into the program and compile it into executables 
4.Load the executable file into the program and either click "Step" or "Execute"
